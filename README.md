# biomarker_random_forest
This is a program is designed to identify biomarkers using random forest algorithm in Python.
andom Forest Program for Biomarker Identification

The following program is designed to identify biomarkers using random forest algorithm in Python. The program is designed to take a dataset containing gene expression values for multiple samples and corresponding phenotype information, and uses a random forest classifier to identify genes that are differentially expressed between the two groups.


The program first imports the necessary libraries and loads the dataset. The dataset should be in a format where rows correspond to genes and columns correspond to samples. The first column should contain gene names and the last column should contain phenotype information (0 or 1) for each sample.

Next, the dataset is split into training and testing sets using a 70-30 ratio. The random forest model is trained on the training set and tested on the testing set. The feature importance scores are calculated for each gene using the trained model.

Finally, the program sorts the genes based on their importance scores and selects the top N genes as potential biomarkers.


Explanation of the Code...

First, we import the necessary libraries, including the random forest classifier from scikit-learn.
Then, we load the dataset using pandas library.
The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split function from scikit-learn.
A random forest classifier is created and trained on the training set using fit method.
The trained model is then used to make predictions on the testing set using predict method.
The feature importance scores for each gene are calculated using feature_importances_ attribute of the trained model.
Finally, we sort the genes based on their importance scores, and select the top N genes as potential biomarkers.
Note: In this example, we have selected the top 10 genes as potential biomarkers. You can adjust this number by changing the value in the line "top_N_genes = [gene[1] for gene in sorted_genes[:10]]".

To run this program, you need to have Python 3 installed and have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip command in your terminal:

pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy


Once you have installed the required packages, save your dataset in a csv format and update the path in line 5 of the code. Then, you can run the program in your terminal using the following command:

python random_forest.py
